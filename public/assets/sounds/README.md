# Game Sound Assets

This directory contains sound effects for the Rabbit Clicker game.

## Required Sound Files

### Click Sound (`click.mp3`)
**Status:** ðŸ”´ Required - Not yet added

A short, satisfying click sound that plays when the player clicks the carrot button.

**Requirements:**
- Format: MP3 (for broad browser compatibility)
- Duration: ~50-200ms (short and snappy)
- Volume: Medium (will be controlled by sound manager)
- Tone: Positive, satisfying (not harsh or annoying)

**Suggestions:**
- Simple pop or tap sound
- Light percussion hit
- UI confirmation sound
- Can be sourced from free sound libraries like:
  - Freesound.org
  - Zapsplat.com
  - Mixkit.co

### Purchase Sound (`purchase.mp3`)
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Planned for RAB-39

A satisfying sound for purchasing upgrades (different from click sound).

## Temporary Workaround

Until actual sound files are added, the sound system will:
- Fail gracefully (no errors)
- Log warnings in console
- Continue gameplay without audio

## Adding Sounds

1. Place sound file in this directory: `public/assets/sounds/click.mp3`
2. Sound will be automatically loaded by the sound manager
3. No code changes needed (path is already configured)

## Sound Manager

The game uses a centralized sound manager (`src/utils/sounds.ts`) that provides:
- Sound caching for performance
- Volume control
- Enable/disable toggle
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Non-blocking playback
