# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a clicker game project. The codebase is currently being initialized.

## Workflow Rules

**IMPORTANT: Task ID Pattern**
- Tasks follow sequential numbering: RAB-1, RAB-2, RAB-3, etc.
- After completing task RAB-X, the next task is ALWAYS RAB-(X+1)
- Do NOT query Linear for the next task - just increment the ID by 1
- Example: After RAB-51, next task is RAB-52
